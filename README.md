# 2D-game-using-C++
Game using concepts of object oriented programming of c++ and external library of c++ that is (SFML)
#LANGUAGE USED:
In our project we are going to using the basic as well as the object-oriented Programming(OOP) techniques of C++ as well as an external library of C++ know as Simple and Fast Multimedia library (SFML). In our project we used different techniques from SFML and C++ to create a small game on window rather then on the console of visual studio. we created animation that move and get destroyed on a certain condition and the player gain some point when ever the player kill/destroy the enemy animation.
#INTRODUCTION:
We have designed a 2d game, which shows the medieval era where a hero (human) stands against the dark lord (who is the mastermind behind all the evil) for humanity. At first, the hero fights all the minions (common enemy) of the dark lord. After defeating the common enemies, the hero faces the dark lord (main boss). There is going to be a mechanism of health which will tell who has won the battle. There is also going to be a scoring mechanism that is going to give the player score for beating each enemy he faces throughout his journey against the dark lord.
